REFLECTION
<What motivated your team to choose this project?>
<Sometimes, when we go to the dining halls, 
 the line is incredibly long and we cant turn back because we already walked 
 all the way. Therefore, we thought this project would be a good way to keep 
 track of the lines at the dining hall. >
<Potential future work/improvements?>
< We did not finish properly linking our code to Nutrislice at Jumbohack, but
 we think it would be great if we did as people will be able to track in real 
 time how busy the dining halls are.
>
<What is a challenge you encountered while making this?>
< There are many challenges that we faced. It was our first time using react.js 
so it took us a while to set it up. Infact we spent more than half of the first 
day trying to get our reactjs files to sync and work. 
It was also our first time using beuatiful soup and collaborating real time on 
git hub so we had a lot of bugs we had not seen before.
